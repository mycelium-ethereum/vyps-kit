# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is a demo site for the Visualise your Protocol Security (VYPS) prototype.
A brief rundown of how this site is laid out.

The core of the app is the same between the full page solution and the widget.

> **Interested developers:** See `SecurityRenderer.js` for the HOC information.

The widget itself is the main driver of the _unique_ architecture of this application.
Every part of the application is optimised to minimise the size of the output JS bundle and keep things blazing fast.
Compiled CSS in JS, no router, minified animations.

**To be even clearer** 
We want to be performant and lean - at least on our partner's pages.

The full page solution is designed to take the same schema as the VYPS widget so they can utilise the same endpoint.
