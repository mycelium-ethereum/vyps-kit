# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is a demo site for the Visualise your Protocol Security (VYPS) prototype.
A brief rundown of how this site is laid out.

The core of the app is the same between the full page solution and the widget.

> **Interested developers:** See `SecurityRenderer.js` for the HOC information.

The widget itself is the main driver of the _unique_ architecture of this application.
Every part of the application is optimised to minimise the size of the output JS bundle and keep things blazing fast.

**To be even clearer** 
We're keeping it performant and lean - at least on our partner's pages.
The full page solution is designed to take the same schema as the VYPS widget so they can utilise the same endpoint.
